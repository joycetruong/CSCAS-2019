  <p> This is the story of an alien!</p>

  <p><a href="file:///Users/aalyanarif/Desktop/Portfolio/website2.html" style="color:ff0000">Aalyan Arif</a> is a new species that hails from the planet called 'Bruh' He is efficient, and has a strange eating habit. He survives primarily on Indomie, which has continuously baffled scientists across the globe.</p>
  <p> His striking resemblance to what we call a 'Chihuahua' makes us wonder if there were always Aalyans amongst us!</p>

  <p> Up next on our list of strange beings is one that crash landed in Europe</p>
